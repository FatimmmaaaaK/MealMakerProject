Meal Maker
This is a Java App that lets the user create and customize a burrito or a taco with their choices and view the calorie count of their full meal once chosen.

To Install: 
This repository can be cloned and run in your IDE. 


Usage: 
1.) The user will start by being welcomed and prompted with the question of if they would like to make a burrito for themselves. 
2.) If the user chooses not to make a burrito the user will be prompted with another option to choose a taco. If the use declines both they are notified that we only serve burritos and tacos. 
3.) If the user choses a burrito they are prompted to choose their rice, meat, beans, and any extra they would like. The user has similar options when choosing a taco, however they are given pre-made taco options to choose from. 
4.) The user is then presented with the option of seeing their meal with or without its caloric information.
5) Once the user choses yes or no, the program will display their choices and if applicable, the caloric information on the meal.
